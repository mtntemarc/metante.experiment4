# PA4 - Data Wrangling and Data Visualization

# I. Intended Learning Outcomes:
1. To identify the codes and functions needed in cleaning and visualizing data
   
2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program that will be used in data wrangling and data visualization

# II. Instructions:
Download the ECE Board Exam 2 dataset found on this link: bit.ly/ECEBoardExamDataset and write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. You may submit your Jupyter notebook in the dedicated submission bin.

# ECE BOARD EXAM PROBLEM: 
Using data wrangling and data visualization technique with storytelling, analyze the data and present different (i) data frames; and (ii) visuals using the dataset given.
1. Create the following data frames based on the format provided: Example: Vis = [“Name”, “Gender”, “Track”, “Math<70”]; hometown is constant as Visayas
   
   A. Filename: Instru = [“Name”, “GEAS”, “Electronics >70”]; where track is constant as Instrumentation and hometown Luzon
   
   B. Filename: Mindy = [ “Name”, “Track”, “Electronics”, “Average >=55”]; where hometown is constant as Mindanao and gender Female
